# LearnC

Repository of files that I developed as I am re-learning C after nearly 20 years
from first learning it. Throughout my career I only dabbled in C, mostly in small
embedded items, and even then they were small specifc use programs.

For this I have chosen to utilize a C programming course through Udemy along 
with the following texts:

- Absolute Beginners Guide to C (ISBN 0-672-30510-0)

The code here represents either excercises outlined durint the Udemy course, in 
the texts, or just ramdom task I thought of to practice the various topics.
